# Projects
This repo is for the EDA community to log their learning projects big and small. When you finish a project you are invited to present it back to the community at one of our events.

### Process
When you find a project you want to commit to add it to the waffle board and assign it to yourself and link to your repo. Find a mentor who can help with code reviews and get support from other people tackling projects.

This isn't exclusive to EDA graduates and if you are a junior developer at a similar skill level feel free to join in.

When you complete the project we will invite some senior developers to formally review the work (though it's a good idea to get feeedback along the way) and you will have the opportunity to formally present it at an EDA demo day if you wish.
