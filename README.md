# Apprentice Projects
Many crafts have the concept of creating a piece of work to demonstrate your skills and graduate from one level to the next. 

Traditionally a masterpiece was work that a journeyor would submit to the masters of their craft for inspection. They would study it closely, nod wisely and proclaim the craftperson suitable for the rank of master and worthy of opening a workshop of their own.

Things are a bit less formal in the software industry but there are some lessons we can borrow from history and the idea of a significant project for both learning and demonstrating your skill is one of them.

When you graduate EDA you are a good chunk of the way through your programming apprenticeship. You should have enough skills that can add enough value to a development team that they will pay you to keep learning but there is still a long way to go.

### Purpose
An apprentice project is a large project that you use to practice and continue your learning journey. It is up to you to pick the project but some suggestions are

* around 500 hours of work
* something you find intensely interesting
* something you will be proud of
* mostly your own work

500 hours is quite a lot of time and we suggest that because it lets you experience the sort of challenges you can only find in larger code bases. 10 fifty hour projects which never interact will be quite a different experience.

Remember these are suggestions only, it's your project so do whatever you like :)

### Process
When you find a project you want to commit to add it to the waffle board and assign it to yourself and link to your repo. Find a mentor who can help with code reviews and get support from other people tackling an apprentice project.

This isn't exclusive to EDA graduates and if you are a junior developer at a similar skill level feel free to join in.

When you complete the project we will invite some senior developers to formally review the work (though it's a good idea to get feeedback along the way) and you will have the opportunity to formally present it at an EDA demo day if you wish.
